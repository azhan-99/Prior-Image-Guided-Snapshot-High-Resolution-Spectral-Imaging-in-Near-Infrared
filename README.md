## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"Prior Image Guided Snapshot High-Resolution Spectral Imaging in Near Infrared"**, published in **IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)**.

We propose a novel method for high-resolution spectral imaging using prior image guidance.

## 🔬 Prototype System Overview

TThe proposed method is validated on two imaging frameworks: CASSI and DDN:

### Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) system
